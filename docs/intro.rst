Introduction
============

Welcome to `pymputator` documentation. This project is an automation tool to the tedious labour imputing our work hours. If you happen to have the same schedule every day, why not just choose a month (or use the current month, by default) and just impute the month! 
Please take into account that this is still under heavy development and there is not yet a stable release.
