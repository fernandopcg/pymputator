pymputator
=========

Pymputator solves what hundreds of Logicalis Spain employees suffer every day: Checking in their work hours in an obsolete, slow, non-standars-compliant and inefficient website.

Now you can be pympin in no time, and quickly get back to work without fear of those warning e-mails every single week
